Pc's (Fendryn & Shooberino) did a task for the Hand of Isford's head of social affairs. Then discovered information about a new drug smuggling ring emerging around the world(Mostly in Frostrock & Azendore). They were then tasked with investigating the apparent leader of this organisation. They are to meet a new PC (nathan) who has been assigned to their team.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Session 1</strong>
<br>
The PC's met Far Gazer's character and they were all pointed to the capital city of <em>Triton</em> in <em>Azendore</em>
Before leaving Isford, the PC's took the time to develop some melon bombs (gunpowder, melons and a fuse) and drank at the <em>Rat and the Shitter 2.0 Sponsored by Cox Machina LLC</em> where they met Bryant's character <strong>Draz' Han</strong> (NPC-ed by me) soon after some shenanigans took place the players took a boat to Azendore and trained during the 2 month journey across the sea. The PC's arrived in Triton, they found information of the Crolano family being involved in the apparent drug syndicate. They eventually came close to encountering Mages Guild members (The PC's are wanted by the guild). The party stopped to gather their thoughts before proceeding to speak with the new head/son of the Crolano Family.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Session 2</strong>
<br>
The PC's had a failed attempt to get information from the Crolano family. They Decided to head to the palace at the top of the city and speak with the head of affairs' Mart-on
They found out that the land of Frostrock was plagued by a deadly disease created from this drug flower they were investigating This disease is only affecting Humans and was created by a powerful warlock. They used a teleporter to travel to Isford and met with Abaruskii to make a plan to help the humans. They are now on a mission to find..
<br>
<em>Sand Trusset Flower</em>
<br>
<em>Ice Trusset Flower</em>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Session 3</strong>
<br>
The PC's traveled to the military castle town of Bayfield. They met with the lord of the castle and asked about any leads for some work. The man told then about a group of missing fighters that went up into the Mire Highlands. (Mountains of Frostrock) He asked the PC's to take a trip up the mountains to see if they can find any clues. While sleeping in a shafty, broken down windmill, the PC's were attacked by 2 Mages Guild Bounty Hunters. They subdued the hunters and proceeded to torture them for information. The PC's rested for the rest of the night and await the next journey.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Session 3.5</strong>
<br>
The PC's awoke and met two Frostrock mages guild members who informed them that the Frostrock mages guild has no means of intervening with their bounty. They also informed them of a way they can get rid of their bounty and told them to go to the Bamor guild and ask for "Fin". They proceeded up the mountains until they came across a bandit stronghold. After what was a very easy surprise attack and battle, the players rescued the tortured fighters held by the high elf bandits. The party is ready to proceed back to Bayfield and receive their reward
<br>
<br>
<strong>Session 3.7</strong>
<br>
The party was about to head back down the mountain untill they encountered a Ice Giant who delt a decent amount of damage. They killed it, took it's bones and are now back in Bayfield after returning the lost fighters and reciveing their reward. The party decided that the first flower they should go after is the Ice Trusset back up higher in the Mire Higlands. What future awaits the party members as they hear word of an country wide evac secretly moving humans out of Frostrock. In fear of spreading the disease, most countries have banned human travel for the time being
<br>
<br>
<strong>Session 4</strong>
<br>
The party made a long journey deep up into the Mire Highlands of Frostrock. With them is a human man named Arthur who was a prisoner at a Orcish camp the party destroyed. He is suffering from the disease and his skin is turning white and his eyes turning deeper blue. He surprisingly can still fight and has energy. They party still keeps him in their sights just in case, with Shooberino keeping him warm, making general attempts to keep the man alive. They come across a ancient Dragonshrine temple with a solid puzzle door on the front and proceed inside. After a bunch of traps and obstacles, the party found a Dragon encased in the wall in stone and freed the White Dragon. They had to make battle with it and they took a lot of damage, but they managed to finish the Dragon off. They proceeded out to the outside section of this chamber and there was the Ice Trussets. They gathered a bunch and proceeded out of the temple and all the way back to Bayfield once again. They started to make the journey to the city if Sleb to meet Abaruskii and travel to Bahla. (Sleb: A military outpost on the border of Frostrock and Breefalls)
<br>
<br>
<strong>Session 5</strong>
<br>
The party made it to Sleb and already talked with Abaruskii about their next move. he had them board a ship and traveled to the deserts of Bahla they first stopped at the small coastal dunes of the town of Nish where a man named Kul Minstose, an eccentric drow who appears to be a soft fighter of sorts but is a rebellious figure of the political landscape of slavery, who was leading these human refugees through the country. He asked the PC's to help him move these people through the country to the other side and when they pass through the capital city of Khuul. He says he will help them find this flower they are looking for. He wants to free a good amount of the slaves that are placed in the slums of the city. He doesnt give details but he says that the owners need to be slaughtered and says it in a way that is chaotic. This concerns the players.

They drop the humans off at a cozy tavern location at the city of Juug but as the night goes on, he shows signs of paranoia and mania. He leads them to this nice looking single house along a wall. He implores them to go in with him, but they refuse and he eventually comes out covered in blood and the players proceed to beat the shit out of him and leave him there.  They head west to the Bahla grasslands to attempt to find the flower themselves.  After a grueling 2 day journey they start seeing bits and pieces of grass here and there.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Session 6</strong>
<br>
<em>The party encounters a giant sand snake</em>
The PC's made battle with this snake, eventually overcoming it, taking it's mean, fangs and venom. Traveling through thr grueling desert, they spotted a small broken down carriage in the distance. Carefully the 4 PC's tried to set up a perimeter, but were quickly overwhelmed and surrounded by 10 members of the Sand Walkers Guild: A group of assassins that dominate the underworld, government and civilian masses through fear, exploitation, blackmail and murder. 
Their leader Timber a tabaxi rogue that is very bold and tricky with his words, has offered them help with finding the Sand Trusset. He tells them of the excommunicated member, murderer of his brothers and other members: Kul Minstose
The players are not that shocked by this, they eventually agree and start to make a insanely long plan to capture Kul and disfigure his face so he wont be recognized by the Sand Guild. After a long 3 day journey, the party makes it back to the city of Juug and after a long squence the players capture Kul, put him in a barrel, throw acid on his face, heal him then leave him with a note telling him to never return fakely signed as Timber. The PC's return to the cove of the Sand guild, and are surprised and delighted to receive a large sack full of at least 25 Sand Trussets. The leader Timber makes one last sketchy dialog and remark which worry the players. They eventually took the trip back to Isford through the means of a magical teleport provided to them by Abaruskii and the Sand guild. With that, the PC's sit at The Rat and the Shitter 2.0 Sponsored by Cox Machina LLC  await the next part of their journey.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Session 7</strong>
<br>
<em>They finally meet the "Warlock"<em>
The party talks to Abaruskii and he introduces a man named Uncle Artica: a old human sorcerer who has apparently designed a cure, is already immune to the disease. They explain that ancient Dwarven technology was stolen from a underground Dwarven palace. (which is highly forbidden in the world. The Dwarves were a smart, tech advanced race until something happened and set their civilization back thousands of years.) They say the device was used to control weather and it was modified to dispense the deadly rainfall. The center piece is is the main piece and they present the players with, a remade version of it. The Sigil Lexicon  The lexicon holds..

<em>Human's Blood</em>
<br>
<em>Dragons Blood</em>
<br>
<em>Sand & Ice Trussets</em,>
Which is apparently what makes the cure

The players proceed up the mountain and firstly encounter a simple Snow Dino, who was hunting up the mountain for any kind of smaller prey, they avoided a avalanche, by means of flying and proceeded up the mountains more until they spotted the tower and the tomb. They attempted to mess with the device, opening it eventually and inserting the new lexicon after taking out the old one. They figured out they had to go inside the tomb and right as they were, a mysterious, armor-robed figure approached them and spoke to them, revealing himself as The Warlock himself and quickly casted a high level spell to destroy the machine. 

The players, angered by this attempt to subdue him and deal damage to him, but he seemingly sponged alot of the damage. He eventually made a leave, after toying and provoking the PC's. He left behind 3 things...
<br>
<br>
Cold Warriors written in the snow.
<br>
A small vial that cant be seen through, feels like there is nothing in it.
<br>
A fast snowfall of Blue snow.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Session 8</strong>
<em> The Party discovers the truth</em>
<br>
After a short grueling battle with the Warlock, the party quickly discovered that the blue snow falling on them, actually ended up giving them the disease, in a attempt to quickly save themselves, they raced back to isford to ask uncle artica for portions of the cure. They travel for 14 days being just on the threshold of not being able to be cured. Rushing into Abaruskii, he explains the unfortunate events that are now taking place: Uncle Artica was apprehended by the soldiers of the Mages Guild placing him under arrest for the practice of forbidden alchemic techniques and is to be magically executed. Thankfully, before he was taken in, he left just enough of the cure for 3 players. 
<br>
(with Abaruskii selflessly giving the last of the cure: his personal portion to Shooby 2.)
<br>
Abaruskii explains that they have a slight plan set in motion to disrupt the public execution.
<br>
-Distract the guards with the help of Don Crolano and his thugs- 
After a long sequence, which consisted of the PCs finding the mage creating the magical dispel forcefield, fendryn was able to dimension door in and out, shooberino transformed into the abomination, which the mages guild recognized and have now placed the "Random Warriors" (name of the PCs that NPCs have given them.) on the list for the most wanted excommunicated members of the guild
<br>
<br>
<br>
After they made it back to Isford, uncle artica admits that he has confessions to make.
<br>
<br>
- The Warlock's real name is Talon Artica,
Uncle Artica's son. 
<br>
<br>
-He tells the story of Talon's rough childhood, loss of his mother, practices of illegal magic and the loss of his childhood friend "sammy".
<br>
<br>
-Talon and his wife were kidnapped and tortured by Human raiders, they murdered his wife and he was falsely sent to prison for the murder of his wife. 
<br>
<br>
-He studied the properties of the dwarves weather technology by using the knowledge his father taught him.
<br>
<br>
-He successfully took his revenge on the humans and arranged the mages guild to execute his father.
<br>
<br>
Uncle Artica explains that the ring that senses 7 other beings are tracking his minions or lieutenants as the party is planning on eliminating them. They decide to head south to Vanet, where one of the lieutenants are apparently traveling the islands.
