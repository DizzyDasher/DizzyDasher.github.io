	<p>A 23-track sequel album to Digital Speed (2015), going from an overflowing electronic, fast paced style to a slowed down, aged (like fine wine) series of tracks that use atmospheric synths, simple repetitive rhythms, and experimental placements. All while being drawn back to the original style of the first Digital Speed.
The idea of the sequel album was initially back in 2016, immediately after the release of the first Digital Speed. Cloudy atmospheric synths, extensive sampling, dance hall & 80s style drums & Aggressive roaring bass lines.
Ideas were crafted from a mix of nostalgia, remixed projects (some over 6 years in age), remastered songs
& unused written lyrics. Most songs range anywhere from 40-100bpm.
	<br>
	<br>
	Featuring @Dr.Kups as usual with mixing and mastering help, remastered songs were also looked over by the both of us.
	These songs were remastered mostly because of the great experience thsat came with producing them in the first place.
