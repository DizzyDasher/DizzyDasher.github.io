	<p>A sequel album to Digital Speed (2015), going from a full electronic, fast paced dance style to a slowed down, aged (like fine wine) series of tracks that use atmospheric synths, simple repetitive rhythms, and small vocal placements. 
	The idea of the sequel album was initially back in 2016, immidiately after the release of the first Digital Speed. Cloudy atmospheric synths, dancehall & 80's style drums & Agressive roaring basslines.
	Ideas were crafted from a mix of nostalgia, remixed projects (some over 6 years in age), remastered songs
	& unused written lyrics. Most songs range anywhere from 40-100bpm.
	<br>
	<br>
	Featuring @Dr.Kups as usual with mixing help, remastered songs were also looked over by the both of us.
	These songs were remastered mostly because of the great experience thsat came with producing them.
